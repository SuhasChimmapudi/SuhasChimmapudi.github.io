                            and applying computer science concepts into real-world projects. While my coding abilities are not strongest, 
                            I do have experience in knowing many languages and frameworks at their most basic level. My most proficient languages are Python and Java, 
                            and that too, I would need a refresher of the intermediate concepts. I also currently am working part-time with the Canadian Government 
                            PSPC branch as an AI Research Assistant.

                            <p>
                            I have worked with Web Design and specifically Frontend UI development a few times before. 
                            First was for a co-op job in high school (March-June 2022). I worked for a company that made a STEM education website 
                            for adoloscents and pre-teens. I mostly focused on making small adjustments to long HTML and CSS code for pages throughout the website. 
                            This experience helped me grasp tags, classes and basic sizing and positioning of web elements using HTML and CSS.</p>

                            <p>
                            The other times I worked on web and UI design was for university course projects. Specifically I worked in a group to create a 
                            <a href="https://github.com/SEG2105BC-uOttawa/seg2105f23-project-project_grp_3"> Cycling Club  app </a> using AndroidStudio for 
                            SEG2105: Intro to Software Engineering. My work was in the XML frontend designs for all pages. In terms of a workflow, it was 
                            easier to split it since we were in a group. Most of the time, I did not have to interact with other aspects of the app. For designing pages, 
                            I drew wireframes of what the most important elements on the webpage are, and then once I make the structure, I add more style elements and organization. </p>
                        
                            <p>
                            I also worked on a <a href="https://github.com/Quynin/CSI2132Deliverable2"> Hotel Management Website </a> with a partner for CSI2132: Databases 1. This website had no styling elements at all. 
                            It was only about the understanding of connecting Frontend with backend and the workflow a working website in between. I taught myself basic JavaScript to add interactivity for all the functions 
                            I needed to make for representing the data that I stored in a backend Database in PostGreSQL. </p>
                            
                            <p>
                            Coming back to the main point, I still do not think I have had enough experience with Frontend development to be able to explain and use a full workflow. But I hope to again a lot of frontend 
                            and UI design experience with this course. I do believe it will be a challenge for me, but I have done some of these processes before, and I am very excited to create cool designs for use-cases, so 
                            I think I should be doing good :) </p> </div>
